# Object Length and Width Determination From An Image

## Introduction

The tool developed during our internship under Forest Research Institute which uses to determine the length and width of a tree from and image. This is developed with the help of mask RCNN which detects the tree and using a reference we calculated the height and width of the tree. This is implemented using Angular2.8 in the form of web app.
